# Why people who are just starting to learn programming shouldn't be afraid of experienced programmers

- What should I do?
- Shoot the fucker!
- But he is so strong, and he was training all his life and he is seasoned in battles
- Just take the God damn rock and shoot the fucker right between the eyes!!!


## You can learn why here:
1.
2. Per my oppinion, from some point in time an inexperienced person is in the same position as experienced. Because people with experience under the belt tend to brute-force the solutions. Take the concept they already know and apply it just in different language/ environment. In general this is good and this is what "experience" is for, but it has some side-effects:
- a tendency to use not the best solution for the current problem, but rather stick to one person is familiar with
- programming languages over the years put a mark of "professional deformation" on the engineer, which ultimately leads to the weirdest outcomes, which I observed many times throughout my career path. Among them, but not limited to:
- writing Java/ C/ JS/ whatever_language_person_used_the_most code with another language syntax. This is especially funny because sometimes you can even guess from which language author of the code is transitioning) By the way it is a very common thing among kids in bilingual environments. Children raised in families that are using several languages are doomed at some point of time spelling words from one language with letters from another +)
- typing and commenting code  in a specific way
- Object-orienting everything everywhere
