# How to Learn Python Junior path

## Getting acquainted
1. Pick up something relatively easy what you can accomplish within a very limited amount of time just to get the taste of language syntax. Timeframe examples:
- one full day of dedicated time or 
- one weekend of relatively dedicated time or 
- one week spending 1-2 hours each day

My weapon of choice was [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).
- There is a [free course on Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). The syntax is not that different from Python 3, difference under the hood at this point is neglectable and you'll figure out the difference between Python 2 and 3 earlier which is good for general literacy.
- Alternative you can fire up a 7-day free trial or buy a subscription and go directly to [Python 3 version](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
**_Note:_** Python 2 vs Python 3 - General notice regarding versions, Python 2 is not currently supported, but you'll find it's traces here and there when you'll start working. Rule of thumb, you shouldn't use it, but you should know it

2. Pick up a simple book and an important thing here - complete it. You may complete not all projects/ tasks in the book, but read the book completely and work your way through at least 30% of practice assignments.

I picked up Python Crash Course(https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036) by [Eric Matthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes/). Very beginner-friendly book. Project-based, it has 3 projects, if you are really in a hurry, take one of the projects you like the most and implement it

3. Find a general on-line introductory course in Python. It basically doesn't matter which. Just go to any of well-known on-line courses like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) or Udemy (https://www.udemy.com) and choose one of top-3 most rated/ most popular courses. Once again the catch here is to complete the course.

I prefer Coursera as their approach to course creation is leaning towards the academic domain. It has a University-like structure with programming assignments, tests and quizzes which become available to you as you advance through theoretical (video/ reading) materials. Some variants:
- I've chosen Coursera's [Diving in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/diving-in-python/home/welcome) but it is rather hardcore and in Russian
- If Russian is a showstopper, you can shoot for the first two courses from this [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

4. Make a habit of exercising in small programming tasks. You won't always have time or inspiration to take on another chunk of videos or theoretical quizzes from your on-line course, but most probably you'll have one hour to spare throughout the day and invest it in a short round of practice. Once again it doesn't matter where you get these tasks, the main thing here is to move on.

You can: 
- Take code tasks from interviews, there plenty of forums with both tasks and solutions. [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is a great place to start, and they have mini-courses and useful materials as well
- You can make your small subroutines that do something useful or useless. I've created several scripts that operate with files, rename them in a particular way, count the number of unique words in text files, etc.
- At the end of the day if you don't have too much imagination and you all about preparation for the interviews, just go to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) it's go-to PaaS (programming as a sport) service. I've completed there Python Language course (107 challenges as of 2018). It also has an [Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit) and [Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)

5. Create a feasible pet project. Just don't try to write second Google, LinkedIn or Facebook. You will bearly scratch the Leviathan. Pick up a project that is educational (require technologies that you are interested in/ required for the job you want to nail down) and in an area that inspires you. Ideally it should be something achievable as MVP to some extent within a month, at most three months if you are in complete time-crunch.

I got lucky and by the time I reached this point one very interesting project started at my company. I developed a protocol for BluePrism and Arduino interaction on RaspberryPi and algorithm to solve [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game which was used in our Robot.
